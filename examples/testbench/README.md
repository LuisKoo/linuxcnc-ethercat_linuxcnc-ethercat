# testbench README

These files are here to perform (semi)-automated testing of new
LinuxCNC-Ethercat builds against known hardware.  LCEC is built and
installed in a physical system connected to actual Ethercat hardware
and then the `haltest.sh` script is run to verify at least a minimal
level of functionality.
