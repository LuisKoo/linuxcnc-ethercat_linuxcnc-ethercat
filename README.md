# linuxcnc-ethercat

This is a LinuxCNC EtherCAT HAL driver.

It was forked from
[sittner/linuxcnc-ethercat](https://github.com/sittner/linuxcnc-ethercat),
and it intended to become the new default version LinuxCNC EtherCAT.
Please bear with us while we do a bit of cleanup here, and then we'll
start looking at adding additional maintainers and merging the backlog
of drivers that has built up over the past few years.
